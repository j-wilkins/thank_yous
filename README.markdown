== Gifts and Thanks

A rails app I wrote on the plane ride home from my honeymoon to keep track of
who sent us what wedding gift and whether or not we'd sent them a thank you card.

A small attempt was made to use twitters bootstrap to make it look pretty, but 
airplane tray tables were not designed for comfortable coding.
